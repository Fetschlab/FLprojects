%% calculate error

% What we want is to use maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), so we need a
% way to calculate the likelihood.
% Here's a refresher (see also likelihood_tutorial.m):

% The likelihood is often written P(data|params), which looks like a 
% conditional density where data varies and params is fixed, but it's
% really kind of the opposite: it's a function of the params for fixed data.

% Confusingly, we don't actually need an equation for the full likelihood
% *function* -- that's the Nparams-dimensional surface which is mapped out
% over many iterations of our fitting routine. The optimization just needs
% to sample the surface sufficiently well to find the maximum.

% What each iteration needs is a functional form for the conditional
% density p(data|params), where data is a set of N trials x 3 observations,
% choice, RT, and confidence. In other words we need a concise way to
% describe the stochastic process that gives rise to the observations,
% given a set of params.

% In likelihood_tutorial.m, the stochastic process is Poisson, the
% observation is a spike count, and params is one-dimensional: some
% stimulus value theta. The probability p(obs|theta) for a given theta
% is either calculated from the equation for the Poisson probability
% mass function, or estimated using a 'histogram method' by generating many
% samples from this distribution.

% This approach seems like it might be amenable to what we're doing here,
% since we're generating the model fits/predictions through monte carlo
% simulation anyway. But there's a key difference: In likelihood_tutorial,
% there was only a scalar observation (the spike count) and an IID set of
% trials (poissrnd(theta)). Here, we have a vector of observations (choice,
% RT, conf) and a non-iid set of trials, each defined by the 4-vector:
% [heading, coh, delta, modality].

% In the Kiani DDM fitting code, it was possible to accumulate (log)
% likelihood trial by trial, because for any combination of coh and
% duration, the model specified a probability of rightward, leftward, and
% sure bet *for that trial*. To replicate this in our monte carlo sim-style
% fitting, we'd have to simulate every combination of hdg, mod, coh, delta
% many times to estimate these probabilities. This is probably too slow to
% be viable, but I may try it anyway.



% For now we'll use least squares just to get it working at all, but need a
% better long term fix... (least squares is equivalent to maximum
% likelihood only in the case of Gaussian error dist, which maybe is close
% enough?)


% normalize before calculating error:
% shift choice back to 0..1, normalize RT, and conf already is 0..1
