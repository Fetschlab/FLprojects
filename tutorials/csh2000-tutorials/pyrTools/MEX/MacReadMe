How to compile a MEX file for Macintosh
(Based on a similar note written by David Brainard and Denis Pelli to accompany the Psychophysics Toolbox.)

A MEX file (short for "MATLAB extension") contains code that implements a new MATLAB function, allowing users to use the full power of the C language and the Macintosh hardware and operating system in implementing a new MATLAB function. This document explains how to produce a MEX file that is "fat" (i.e. will run as native code on both 68K and PowerPC Macs) and is compatible with both MATLAB 4 and 5.

1) To produce a MATLAB MEX file with PowerPC code you must have the Metrowerks CodeWarrior C compiler (version 10 or better, abbreviated as CW below). To produce 68K code we still use the Symantec THINK C compiler (version from Symantec C++ 8 CD-ROM release 5), but we will soon be switching to Metrowerks CodeWarrior. (See note A below.)

2) Place a copy of the MATLAB 4:Extern folder, supplied by Mathworks, on your compiler's search path. We suggest that you name the copy "MEX V4". (See notes B and C, below.) 

3) Build any of the MEX files simply by opening its project file and asking your compiler to "Build Code Resource" (in THINK C) or to "Make" it (in CW).  For each MEX file, e.g. histo.mex, there are two associated projects, e.g. histo.
